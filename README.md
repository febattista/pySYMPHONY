# Python interface for SYMPHONY Branch-and-Cut solver
This Python module provide a simple interface to the C/C++ SYMPHONY MILP Branch-and-Cut solver from the [COIN-OR Foundation](https://github.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY). 
The interface uses [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to create Python bindings to the C functions.
